# Administration User Interface
The main goal of this project is to replace the administration interface [ngcp-panel](https://github.com/sipwise/ngcp-panel) using a modern web technology stack.
The ngcp-panel is written in Perl and is the main web interface, that allows administrators to configure and provision the [Sipwise VoIP Platform](https://www.sipwise.org).
The plan is to decouple the new interface from the backend completely, and to evolve it to a service oriented architecture.
We are using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide "What is Vue.js?") as core frontend technology and the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar "What is Quasar?") as UI- and Component-Framework that builds on top of Vue.js.

## Concepts
We are using the [quasar-cli](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) as main development tool to get the full developer experience.

List of additional packages:
* State management: [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org)
* HTTP client: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* I18n: [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n)

## Getting started
To be able to contribute to the new administration interface you need to go through the following steps.

### Install Sipwise VoIP Platform
First install an instance of the [Sipwise VoIP Platform](https://www.sipwise.org/products/spce/quickinstall "Installation Guide") to be able to access the REST-API. Check the according [documentation](https://www.sipwise.org/products/spce/documentation/) for more information.

### Configure Sipwise VoIP Platform
Enable CORS headers to be able to access the REST-API from the application on your local machine.

    ngcpcfg set /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml www_admin.http_admin.ui_enable=yes
    ngcpcfg set /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml www_admin.http_csc.csc_dev=yes
    ngcpcfg apply "enable ngcp-admin-ui dev mode"

### Clone repository
Clone the repository to your local machine

    git clone git@github.com:sipwise/ngcp-admin-ui.git
    cd ngcp-admin-ui.git

### Run Quasar development server locally in Docker

Prerequisites:
* [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

Run the following command from root folder of git repository:

    yarn run docker-dev <ip-or-fqdn-of-sipwise-voip-platform>

### Run Quasar development server within the Sipwise VoIP platform
To get the full developer experience we need to run the development server within the Sipwise VoIP Platform.

    ./bin/ngcp-dev.sh <ip-or-fqdn-of-sipwise-voip-platform>
