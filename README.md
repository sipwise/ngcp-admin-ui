# Administration User Interface
The main goal of this project is to replace the administration interface [ngcp-panel](https://github.com/sipwise/ngcp-panel) using a modern web technology stack.
The ngcp-panel is written in Perl and is the main web interface, that allows administrators to configure and provision the [Sipwise VoIP Platform](https://www.sipwise.org).
The plan is to decouple the new interface from the backend completely, and to evolve it to a service oriented architecture.
We are using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide "What is Vue.js?") as core frontend technology and the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar "What is Quasar?") as UI- and Component-Framework that builds on top of Vue.js.

## Concepts
We are using the [quasar-cli](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) as main development tool to get the full developer experience.

List of additional packages:
* State management: [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org)
* HTTP client: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* I18n: [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n)

## Getting started
To be able to contribute to the new administration interface you need to go through the following steps.

### Install Sipwise VoIP Platform
First install an instance of the [Sipwise VoIP Platform](https://www.sipwise.org/products/spce/quickinstall "Installation Guide") to be able to access the REST-API. Check the according [documentation](https://www.sipwise.org/products/spce/documentation/) for more information.

### Configure Sipwise VoIP Platform
Enable CORS headers to be able to access the REST-API from the application on your local machine.

    ngcpcfg set /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml www_admin.http_admin.ui_enable=yes
    ngcpcfg set /etc/ngcp-config/config.yml www_admin.http_csc.csc_dev=yes
    ngcpcfg apply "enable ngcp-admin-ui dev mode"

### Clone repository
Clone the repository to your local machine

    git clone git@github.com:sipwise/ngcp-admin-ui.git
    cd ngcp-admin-ui.git

### Fetch Docker dev environment

Run the following command from root folder of git repository:
    docker pull ngcp-admin-ui-buster
    docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -i -t -v $(pwd):/code:rw ngcp-admin-ui-buster:latest t/run_admin_ui <ip-or-fqdn-of-your-installation>

### Install Node.js and NPM locally (skip if Docker env is in use)

The easiest and most convenient way to install the right Node.js and NPM version for your development environment, is to use the [Node.js Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
The Node.js Version Manager allows you to manage more than one Node.js and NPM versions at the same time and enables you to work on projects with differing Node.js versions.

[Install Node.js Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)

The version you need to install is v10.21.0 (npm v6.14.4).

    nvm install 10.21.0

Check node and npm version.

    node -v
    # v10.21.0

    npm -v
    # 6.14.4

### Install dependencies  (skip if Docker env is in use)

    npm ci

### Configure application  (skip if Docker env is in use)
Before the web interface can access the REST-API, we need to configure the base URLs.
Create a new application configuration file "app.js" under "/src/config" and set
the following properties.

```javascript
export default {
	ngcpPanelUrl: 'https://ip-or-fqdn-of-your-installation:1443',
	ngcpApiUrl: 'https://ip-or-fqdn-of-your-installation:1443/api'
}
```

### Run in the application in development mode  (skip if Docker env is in use)

    npm run dev
